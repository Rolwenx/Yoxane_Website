# Web Programming Course Project: Yoxane
This project is a non-functional website. It is only a website that was used for our computer science studies when we were learning how to design websites with the use of HTML and CSS.
It is a website allowing two artists (Yoke and Roxane) to sell their artworks on one website, and allow users to make commissions.
